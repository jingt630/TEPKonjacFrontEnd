# Translation 404 Error - Diagnosis & Fix

## 🐛 The Problem

You're getting a **404 Not Found** error when trying to load translations:
```
Failed to load translations: 404 404 Not Found
```

## ❗ Important: CSS/Vue Changes Did NOT Cause This

The CSS and Vue file changes I made were **purely visual** (colors, fonts, button styles). They **cannot** cause API endpoint errors. The 404 means the backend endpoint is not responding.

## 🔍 What's Actually Wrong

The endpoint being called is:
```
http://localhost:8000/api/Translation/_getTranslationsByOriginalTextId
```

A 404 error means one of these:

### 1. **Backend Not Running** (Most Likely)
The Deno backend server needs to be running on port 8000.

**Check if it's running:**
- Look for a terminal window with Deno output
- Try accessing: http://localhost:8000/api in your browser
- If you see "Cannot GET /api", the backend IS running
- If the page won't load, the backend is NOT running

**To start the backend:**
```powershell
# Navigate to your backend folder (where server.ts is)
cd path\to\backend

# Run with permissions
deno run --allow-all server.ts
```

### 2. **Wrong Backend Folder Name**
The backend auto-registers endpoints based on folder names in `concepts/`.

Your frontend expects: `/Translation/...`
But if your backend folder is named differently (e.g., `translations/` or `Translate/`), it won't work.

**Check:**
1. Go to your backend `concepts/` folder
2. Make sure there's a folder called exactly `Translation` (capital T)
3. Inside should be `Translation.ts`

### 3. **Backend Not Registered Properly**
The backend might not have loaded the Translation concept.

**Check backend console output for:**
```
✅ Registered concept: Translation
```

If you don't see this, the concept isn't loading.

## ✅ What I Fixed

I've made the error **non-fatal** so your page will still load even if translations can't be fetched. You'll see a warning in console instead of the page breaking:

```
⚠️ Could not load translations (non-fatal): 404 ...
```

## 🔧 How to Fix It

### Step 1: Check if Backend is Running
```powershell
# In a NEW terminal/PowerShell window
cd path\to\your\backend\folder
deno run --allow-all server.ts
```

You should see output like:
```
✅ Registered concept: MediaManagement
✅ Registered concept: TextExtraction
✅ Registered concept: Translation
✅ Registered concept: Rendering
✅ Registered concept: User
🚀 Server listening on http://localhost:8000
```

### Step 2: Check the Console
Open browser DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
📍 Calling endpoint: http://localhost:8000/api/Translation/_getTranslationsByOriginalTextId
```

This will show you the exact URL being called.

### Step 3: Test the Endpoint Directly
Open a new browser tab and try:
```
http://localhost:8000/api
```

- **If it loads**: Backend is running ✅
- **If it doesn't load**: Backend is NOT running ❌

### Step 4: Verify Backend Folder Structure
Your backend should look like:
```
backend/
├── server.ts
├── concepts/
│   ├── MediaManagement/
│   ├── TextExtraction/
│   ├── Translation/        ← Must be exactly this name
│   │   └── Translation.ts
│   ├── Rendering/
│   └── User/
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Start your backend** if it's not running
2. **Refresh your frontend page**
3. **Check the console** - you should see:
   ```
   📍 Calling endpoint: http://localhost:8000/api/Translation/_getTranslationsByOriginalTextId
   ```
   Followed by either:
   - `✅ Translation loaded` (success)
   - `⚠️ Could not load translations` (warning, but page still works)

## 📝 Summary

- **The CSS changes did NOT break the API**
- The 404 error means the backend isn't responding
- I've made the error non-fatal so your page loads anyway
- You need to start/restart your backend server
- The page will work fine without translations loading - you just won't see existing translations until the backend is connected

Try starting your backend and let me know what you see in the console! 🚀
