# 🔧 Upload & Preview Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Image Preview 404 Errors
**Problem:** Browser was trying to fetch images from `_getMediaFile` endpoint, which returns JSON metadata, not actual image files.

**Solution:** Disabled the image preview URL for now. Images will show a nice placeholder icon (🖼️) until backend supports serving actual image files.

**Changes:**
- `src/components/MediaCard.vue` - Removed the broken backend image URL call

---

### ✅ Issue 2: No Auto-Refresh After Upload
**Problem:** After uploading a file, it wouldn't appear in the gallery until manually refreshing the page.

**Solution:** Added better logging and ensured the refresh happens at multiple levels.

**Changes:**
- `src/composables/useMedia.js` - Added detailed logging to track the upload and refresh process
- `src/components/FileUpload.vue` - Added logging and small delay to ensure state propagates
- `src/AppAuth.vue` - Added explicit refresh call in the parent handler

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

1. **Navigate to a folder** (create one if needed)
2. **Click "Upload"** button
3. **Select an image** (e.g., Mufasa.png)
4. **Click "Upload to Server"**

### Expected Console Output:
```
🚀 Starting upload... { path: '/yourfolder', filename: 'Mufasa.png' }
📤 Uploading file to: /yourfolder
📤 Sending upload with userId: user:xxxxx
✅ Upload successful! Refreshing media list...
📂 Loading media from path: /yourfolder
📁 Folders received: [...]
📄 Files received: [...]
✅ Media loaded. Folders count: X
🔄 Media list refreshed. Files count: 1
✅ Upload completed successfully!
🔄 Parent component ensuring refresh...
📂 Loading media from path: /yourfolder
✅ Parent refresh complete. Files: 1 Folders: X
```

### What You Should See:
1. ✅ **Alert:** "File uploaded successfully!"
2. ✅ **File appears in gallery immediately** (no manual refresh needed)
3. ✅ **Nice placeholder icon** (🖼️ for images, 📄 for other files)
4. ✅ **No 404 errors** in console
5. ✅ **File uploaded to correct folder** (the one you're currently viewing)

## 📷 About Image Previews

The image preview is **temporarily disabled** because the backend doesn't serve actual image files yet.

### To Enable Image Previews (Backend Work Required):

You need to add a new endpoint to your backend that serves the actual image bytes:

#### 1. Add to `MediaManagement.ts`:

```typescript
/**
 * _serveImage(userId: ID, mediaId: ID): File
 *
 * Serves the actual image file
 */
async _serveImage({ userId, mediaId }: { userId: ID; mediaId: ID }) {
  const mediaFile = await this.mediaFiles.findOne({
    _id: mediaId,
    owner: userId
  });

  if (!mediaFile) {
    throw new Error("Media file not found or access denied");
  }

  // Read the actual file from local storage
  const filePath = `./uploads/${userId}/${mediaFile.filePath}/${mediaFile.filename}`;
  const fileData = await Deno.readFile(filePath);

  return {
    data: fileData,
    contentType: `image/${mediaFile.mediaType}`
  };
}
```

#### 2. Update `concept_server.ts` to handle file responses:

The server needs to detect when a method returns file data and send it as a binary response instead of JSON.

#### 3. Uncomment in `MediaCard.vue`:

```typescript
const imageUrl = computed(() => {
  const isImage = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif', 'webp'].includes(
    props.mediaFile.mediaType?.toLowerCase()
  )

  if (!isImage) return null

  return `${API_BASE_URL}/MediaManagement/_serveImage?userId=${userStore.userId}&mediaId=${props.mediaFile._id}`
})
```

## 🎨 Current Placeholder UI

Files now show beautiful placeholder icons:
- 🖼️ **Images** - PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP
- 📄 **Other files** - PDF, TXT, etc.

The placeholder includes:
- Large centered icon
- File type label (e.g., "PNG", "JPG")
- Proper styling and spacing

---

## 🐛 Debugging

If the file still doesn't appear after upload, check the browser console for:

1. **Upload logs** - Should show the upload path and result
2. **Refresh logs** - Should show media being reloaded
3. **File count** - Should increment after upload

If you see the upload succeed but the file doesn't appear, check:
- Is the `currentPath` correct? (shown in breadcrumb)
- Is the `userId` being sent correctly?
- Does the backend successfully save the file?
- Check backend terminal for any errors
