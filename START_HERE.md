## 🎯 Answer to Your Question

### "What does 'passing and pushing data' mean?"

**Short Answer:** It's about how Vue components communicate with each other - NOT about MongoDB!

- **Passing (↓)** = Props - Parent gives data to child
- **Pushing (↑)** = Events - Child sends signals to parent
- **Reactive** = UI updates automatically when data changes

**Read these docs in order:**

1. **`UNDERSTANDING_THE_INSTRUCTION.md`** ⭐ **START HERE** - Plain English explanation
2. **`COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Technical details about component communication
3. **`DATA_FLOW_EXAMPLES.md`** - Step-by-step scenarios
4. **`QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** - Cheat sheet for common tasks

---

## 🏃 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Your Backend
Make sure your backend is running at `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Start Frontend Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open in Browser
Visit `http://localhost:5173`

| **COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md** | Want to understand how components work together? |
| **DATA_FLOW_EXAMPLES.md** | Need to see real examples of data flow? |

## 🔍 How the App Works

### Data Flow Example: User Deletes a File

```
1. User clicks "Delete" on MediaCard
   ↓
2. MediaCard emits 'delete' event ↑
   ↓
3. MediaGallery receives event, re-emits ↑
   ↓
4. App.vue receives event
   ↓
5. App.vue calls API → Backend → MongoDB
   ↓
6. Backend responds with success
   ↓
7. App.vue updates local state (reactive)
   ↓
8. Vue automatically updates UI
   ↓
9. File disappears from screen (NO REFRESH!)
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Components pass data via **props** (parent → child)
- ✅ Components send events via **emit** (child → parent)
- ✅ UI updates **automatically** (reactive)
- ✅ Backend (MongoDB) is called only when needed
- ✅ No page refresh required

## 🔧 Common Tasks

### Change Backend URL

Edit `src/config/api.js`:
```javascript
export const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api';
// Change to your backend URL
```

### Add a New Component

1. Create file in `src/components/`
2. Define props and events
3. Import in parent component
4. Use with `<MyComponent :prop="data" @event="handler" />`

See `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for code examples.

### Add a New API Endpoint

1. Add endpoint to `src/config/api.js`
2. Add method to `src/services/mediaApi.js`
3. Use in component or composable

---

## 🎓 Key Concepts You've Learned

### ✅ Component Communication
- Props: Pass data from parent to child
- Events: Send data from child to parent
- Clear data flow (predictable and debuggable)

### ✅ Reactivity
- Data changes trigger automatic UI updates
- No manual DOM manipulation
- No page refreshes needed

### ✅ Separation of Concerns
- Each component has one responsibility
- API logic separated into service layer
- Reusable composables for shared logic

### ✅ Modern Vue 3 Patterns
- Composition API (`<script setup>`)
- Reactive refs (`ref()`, `reactive()`)
- Composables for state management
- Props and emits for communication

## 💡 What Your Instructor Wants to See

Your app demonstrates:

1. **Multiple Components** ✅
   - FolderBrowser, MediaGallery, MediaCard, MediaDetails

2. **Props (Passing Data Down)** ✅
   ```vue
   <MediaGallery :media-files="mediaFiles" />
   ```

3. **Events (Pushing Data Up)** ✅
   ```vue
   <MediaCard @delete="handleDelete" />
   ```

4. **Reactive UI** ✅
   - No page refreshes
   - Automatic updates when data changes

5. **Separation of Concerns** ✅
   - Each component has clear responsibility
   - API calls separated into service layer

6. **Clean Architecture** ✅
   - Components communicate through defined interfaces
   - State managed in logical places
   - Reusable composables

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### MongoDB vs Component Communication

**Your MongoDB backend:**
- Stores data permanently
- Responds to HTTP API calls
- Is the "source of truth"

**Component props/events:**
- Share data temporarily in browser
- Components talk to each other
- Independent from database

**They're separate concerns!** The instruction is about component communication, not database operations.

### No Page Refreshes

When data changes:
```javascript
// ❌ OLD WAY (wrong)
window.location.reload()

// ✅ VUE WAY (correct)
mediaFiles.value.push(newFile)  // UI updates automatically!
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Read `UNDERSTANDING_THE_INSTRUCTION.md`** to fully grasp the concepts
2. **Run the app** (`npm install` then `npm run dev`)
3. **Explore the components** in `src/components/`
4. **Try modifying** a component and see reactive updates
5. **Add new features** using the patterns you've learned
6. **Reference** `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` when coding
